# 11ty Cover Theme
A hopefully stylish 11ty **minor** update to the common cover card theme type. This 11ty theme is based on:
1. [Front Cover Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/dashingcode/front-cover) by [@dashingcode](https://github.com/dashingcode/front-cover)
2. [@epidrome's cover-card Fork of Front Cover Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/epidrome/cover-card) by [@epidrome](https://github.com/epidrome/cover-card)
3. [Eleventy Base Blog Starter Project](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog)
